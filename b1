1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: 
This is a cloud computing model where a provider hosts the infrastructure components virtually, such as servers, storage, and networking. 
Users can rent these resources on a pay-as-you-go basis. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine.

2. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: This model delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. 
Users access these applications through a web browser, and the provider manages everything from the infrastructure to the software itself. 
Examples include Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and Salesforce.

3. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: 
PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure. 
It typically includes development tools, database management systems, and deployment capabilities. 
Examples are Google App Engine, Heroku, and Microsoft Azure App Service.

Each service model offers different levels of control, management, and functionalities to users based on their specific needs in the cloud computing environment.
